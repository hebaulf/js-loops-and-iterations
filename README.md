# Js loops and iterations

### This is my project for JavaScript loops and iterations (for/while)

I initially wrote it up using Repl.it and then added an .html and .css file and created a Github repo and a Github Page to view also.

Comments for each block of code is in the .js file.  
The code can also be viewed on the live site and Replit. (links below)
